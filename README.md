# Palindromic


This Python program asks the user for a word, phrase, or sentence and tells them if the texts they have entered is a palindrome.

In order to do this, the program takes out all punctiation and white space.  With the remaining characters, the program compares the begining and end ofthe text, making sure they are equal working its way to the middle.  If any part of the reflective text is not equal, its stops, and lets the user know it is not a palindrome.  If it continues all the way to the middle with all conditions being True, then you get a message letting the user know that the text is in fact a palindrome.
